# Amnesiac
A Role-Playing, Thriller Text-Based Game


Overview of the Game:

The game is called Amnesiac, whose main character is Max. Max wakes up in a haunted house with no recollection of who he is and where he is. Max wakes up in a bedroom at the beginning of the game. There are 7 other rooms inside the house, excluding the bedroom. The other rooms are the kitchen, the dining room, Laura’s bedroom (who we come to find is his daughter), the basement, the living room, the bathroom, and the garage. In order to be able to regain his memories, Max can go around the house into the various rooms and interact with objects that will trigger his memories of who he is and his family. Furthermore, as he goes through the rooms, he looks around and finds creatures there which he has to attack to be able to survive. Before fighting the creatures, Max can interact with certain creatures before attacking, and some creatures he simply runs away from. It is important to note that Max can die if his health level is 0 before a creature’s is. However, in the case that Max does defeat the monster/creatures, when he walks to a new room his health is automatically back up to 100. Furthermore, when attacking, Max is able to use “potion” in order to gain the upper hand and gain health points. Around the house, there are various objects in the rooms with which Max has to interact with. These objects serve multiple functions. Some of the objects are purely there for him to use, or for him to get information from. Other objects are there to trigger his memories of his past life, where we are introduced to his wife Jessica, and his daughter, Laura. There are objects that trigger the monster/creatures, and these same objects can be used to defeat the creatures that they trigger. Max has to go through each room of the house, in order to interact with objects, regain some of his memory, and fight off creatures. After he goes through each room in the house, a key will reveal itself and instruct him on how to get out of the house. It is important to note that the game has a timer of 15 minutes, and regardless of whether or not Max has defeated the monster, if he is not out of the house then the game is over, and the user must restart the game.


Objective:

The game starts off by the character waking up with no memory whatsoever. The objective of the game is to cascade through all the rooms, interact with objects, trigger flashbacks and fight off different creatures in a haunted house. Doing so, will spawn a key that will allow the character to exit the house and instruct how to do so. As he goes through each room in the house, he encounters several monsters some of which he must fight & defeat, and others that he can simply run away from. After going through each room in the house, the location for the key will reveal itself with instructions on how to use it in order to leave. Moreover, as he goes through each room, he picks up objects along the way that trigger flashbacks about who he was, as he wakes up with no memories. These memories are his motivation for wanting to get out of the house, which he does when he regains them, walks through each room and defeat any monsters in it. When Max finds the key, he is then told where to go and what to do in order to be able to use it and exit the house, winning the game. The game has a timer of 15 minutes, and if the 15 minutes are up, then the game is terminated as Max is unable to escape in time and the user must restart the game. Also, if the user dies in a combat in the middle of game, the user must restart the game from the start.
